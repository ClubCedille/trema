How to connect to mongoShell:
Run your docker container first
Then, do the following commands on your terminal

docker ps (grab the container id)
docker exec -it (container id) bash
mongo mongodb://localhost:27017 -u root -p root

------------------------------

Create database on mongoShell

run command: use (database name);
will create if it doesn't already exist. Otherwise,
it will switch databases

run db.getName(); to get the database name

run show dbs; to see all databases. You won't see your
newly created database if you do not create a collection first

------------------------------

Create collection on mongoShell

run command db.createCollection("*insert collection name*");

------------------------------

Insert document on mongoShell

if you want to insert a document, you can define a variable first.

Example: user1 = {
    "name": "Derek",
    "lastName": "Morgan"
}

put that in the shell and enter

you can then do db.*collectionName*.insert(user1);.

Say you have a collection called user and you want to insert user1,
it would look like
db.user.insert(user1);

Note: you can always create a collection through this command. So, if
the collection doesn't already exist, mongoDB will create it for you.

------------------------------

Get documents in collection on mongoShell

db.user.find().pretty();
db.user.count(); gives the number of documents in a collection


------------------------------

Drop database/collection on mongoShell

db.dropDatabase();
db.user.drop();

------------------------------

Capped collections on mongoShell

Capped collections are fixed-size collections that support operations to
insert and retrieve documents based on insertion order.

db.createCollection("student", {
    capped: true,
    size: 614200,
    max: 500
});

size is the size in bytes and max is the maximum number of documents.

------------------------------

See collections on mongoShell

db.getCollectionNames();
